    "# Working with Lessons on Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson you will practice the workflow we will be using for the rest of the course and also get some hands-on practice with important tools that you will need to be familiar with as a professional Data Scientist: the command line, git, GitHub, and Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "* Use basic commands to navigate the command line\n",
    "* Use bash commands to create new files and folders\n",
    "* Use git clone to clone a repository\n",
    "* Perform cell operations within Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setting the Stage\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two types of lessons on Learn - **README**s, where you are mainly reading text or watching videos and perhaps executing a code block or two just to see what happens. For those lessons, you don't need to know *any* of what we're teaching below. All you need to do is to read them on Learn. Enjoy!\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are some lessons that require you to write code - **Projects** and **Labs**. Generally, labs are a little shorter, allowing you to practice a specific skill in isolation (like practicing throwing the ball up without hitting it to improve your tennis serve). Projects come towards the end of a section and are more open-ended, allowing you to bring together a range of different skills that you have learned (like playing a whole game of tennis - or at least practicing a complete serve).\n",
    "\n",
    "It's easy to tell from a lesson's title if it is a Project, a Lab, or a README. If the title ends with \"Lab\", it's a lab. If the title starts with the word \"Project\", it's a project. If the title doesn't end with either a \"Lab\" or a \"Project\", it's a README!\n",
    "\n",
    "**The process we're teaching you below is only required for labs and projects - not READMEs**\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Command Line\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get to Jupyter Notebooks, we'll need to know a tiny bit about command line. On Mac computers, this is the terminal application. On Windows computers, we'll use \"Git Bash\". The command line serves as a low-level interpreter through which you, the user, can send commands directly to the computer. As a computer user, you previously have probably sent commands to the computer through a graphical user interface (GUI) such as a web browser, text editor, photo editor, or any other of the myriad of computer programs now in existence. While the command line is initially daunting with its cryptic looking text, we will quickly see some of the many advantages it can have.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the many useful features of the command line will be using *git* to clone (download) a local copy of the curriculum hosted on learn.co. This will allow you to work offline and to save changes as you work through exercises and start programming! \n",
    "\n",
    "To start, **for Mac users, open the terminal application**, **for Windows, open “Git Bash”**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### pwd\n",
    "\n",
    "The first command to try out is **pwd** which stands for **print working directory**. This will tell you where you currently are in the computer's directory structure. Try it out.\n",
    "\n",
    "### cd\n",
    "\n",
    "The next essential command is **cd** which stands for **change directory**. This allows you to navigate to different folders on your computer's hard drive. Typing cd by itself will automatically take you to your home directory. Typing cd and a folder name will take you to that folder. Typing cd .. will move you one folder up in the hierarchy. Play around and trying moving between folders for a minute or two.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tab Completion\n",
    "\n",
    "An extraordinarly useful feature when working with the command line is tab completion. This allows you to hit the tab button to autocomplete names once you have made a unique specification.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you navigate to your root directory by running the command **cd**, if you're on a Mac, you will probably have 2 folders within your root directory named \"Downloads\" and \"Documents\" (these are standard folder names created by default in most systems, although you may have renamed them, or your system may be different). With these, or longer folder names, it can sometimes become cumbersome to type the full folder name. instead, you can start typing the command and folder name such as **\"cd Dow\"** and then press **tab** to autocomplete. Like magic, the command line should complete the statement correctly to be **cd Downloads**. (Note: this will not work if you have another folder that begins with \"Dow\". Similarly, if you just typed **cd D** or **cd Do** followed by **tab**, the command line will not autocomplete, as the selection is not unique, because **D** or **Do** could both refer to either **Documents** or **Downloads**. Also note that these commands are case sensitive, and folder capitalization much be matched exactly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ls\n",
    "\n",
    "Continuing with navigating the computer's hard drive, it's useful to know how to **list files**. This is done with the **ls** command, short for list.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also pass optional parameters to ls such as **ls -a** which lists **all files** (including hidden files), **ls -l** gives a **long listing** of files (including file size and last edit times). You can also pass multiple parameters simultaneously such as **ls -al** to produce a detailed listing of all files.\n",
    "\n",
    "### * the wildcard parameter\n",
    "\n",
    "Also very useful is the wildcard parameter. For example, if you wanted to list all files in the current working directory that begin with a, you could type **`ls a*`**. Here, the asterix (`*`) denotes anything is allowed following the a. Similarly, to list all pdf files in the current working directory you can use **`ls *.pdf`**, or to list all text files, you can use **`ls *.txt`**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### mkdir\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, as you continue to navigate the file directory from the command line it can be useful to be able to create new folders. To do this, use the **mkdir** command, which stands for **make directory**. Try it out with **mkdir NewFolderName**. Afterward, use the **ls** command to see that there is indeed a new folder, and if you wish, move into the new folder using the **cd** command.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cloning GitHub repositories and Learn.co lessons\n",
    "\n",
    "You have already read a little bit about GitHub and how it's used to share code. Since you can now navigate the file directory using the command line, you're ready to download some course materials from GitHub to your local environment. In practice, you will do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Fork** the course material repository: Forking is the process of making a personal copy of the Learn course materials on your own GitHub account.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Clone** the forked course material repository: Cloning is the process of downloading a repository from Github onto your personal computer. \n",
    "\n",
    "Don't worry if this process seems a little confusing. It will be explained in more detail soon. For now, you can just follow the steps below: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Create a folder on your computer for your course materials and navigate into it  \n",
    "* Then create a subfolder titled \"section01\" and navigate into that \n",
    "* Return to your web browser and navigate to the lesson you want to download \n",
    "* Click the GitHub icon \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/learn_github_logo.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll be redirected to the associated GitHub repository like this.  \n",
    "* **Click the fork button**, as shown in order to create a copy to your personal account which you can edit and update.\n",
    "<img src=\"images/github_fork_button.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "One of two things will happen. Either it'll pop up a modal (window) and if you scroll to the bottom of it you'll see it says that you already have a fork. That is quite possible - Learn auto-forks certain lessons for you. If that's the case, just click on the link to view your existing fork.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't already have a fork, after a moment of this:\n",
    "<img src=\"images/github_forking_in_progress.png\" width=\"700\">\n",
    "You'll be redirected to your new personal copy of the repository:\n",
    "<img src=\"images/forked_github_page.png\" width=\"900\">\n",
    "\n",
    "## Finally: \n",
    "* Press **cmd+L** to highlight the url bar and **cmd+c** to copy the url (whenever we use `cmd` to refer to holding down the command key on a Mac computer, on a Windows computer, hold down the control key instead)\n",
    "* Return to the terminal (you should be in your \"section01\" folder)\n",
    "* Type: **git clone** and paste your repo url (**cmd + v** for Mac; for Windows, in git bash, **shift + insert**)\n",
    "* Et Voila! The repository and all of its contents will be downloaded locally to your computer!\n",
    "* Remember that you then need to **cd** into the new repository once you've downloaded it\n",
    "* The next step is to open your Jupyter Notebook locally (**not on Learn**) using the command line\n",
    "\n",
    "## Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "So, now that you understand a bit about how to use the terminal and how to clone GitHub repositories from our Learn lessons, we should talk about the Jupyter Notebooks that will run most of the content in this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure to activate your conda virtual environment in your terminal first by typing `source activate learn-env`. Then type `jupyter notebook` in your command line and press enter. Next, your default browser will open a new window or tab and you will see the list of files that are in your current directory (*remember you want to be in the GitHub repo directory that we just downloaded*). \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** *To stop a Jupyter Notebook, go to your command line where the notebook is running and press the **control** key + the letter **c*** (**`ctrl`**+**`c`**).\n",
    "\n",
    "Then click on the `index.ipynb` file which is the Jupyter Notebook we will be using in this and future labs and lessons. This will open a new tab where you will see the same content from Learn!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background on Jupyter \n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter is a web application that allows you to create and work with documents that have live code.  It's a very popular tool among Data Scientists, as it allows for both explanations of thinking behind code as well as the code itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction to cells\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook itself consists of cells. Double click on this content in Jupyter notebook to see what we mean. Once you double click on a cell, you are in insert mode. This means that you are able to edit the cells, just as you would if this were a word document. You can tell that you are in insert mode because of the green border around the cell.  \n",
    "\n",
    "After entering insert mode for this cell, change some content. Don't worry about what you change as you can always undo it. You can revert the changes to a cell by making sure that you are still in insert mode and by pressing `command + z` on a Mac or `control + z` on Windows.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get out of insert mode and see the effect of your changes, press `shift + enter`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Adding cells\n",
    "\n",
    "If you wish to quickly add a new cell you can do so using the following steps: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Make sure you are not in insert mode\n",
    "    * *Remember you can tell you are in insert mode when you have a green border around the cell*\n",
    "    * To get out of insert mode, press `shift + enter`.  Another option is to press the escape key \n",
    "    * You will no longer see a cell bordered in green \n",
    "* Then press the letter `b` to create a new cell \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Deleting cells\n",
    "\n",
    "To delete a cell you once again should be in escape mode, and then press the `x` key.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, you'll want a way to undo your deletion.  From escape mode, you can press `z` to undo deletion of a cell.  Note that this is different from `cmd + z`.  Pressing `cmd + z` while in insert mode undoes any changes inside of a cell while, whether these changes be deletions or text insertions.  Pressing `z` from escape mode undoes the deletion of a cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "Go to escape mode and press `x`. This cell disappears!\n",
    "\n",
    "Then bring it back with `z`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Cells\n",
    "\n",
    "The current cell and every other cell in this lesson is a markdown cell, meaning that it allows us to write text and stylize that text. For example, if you surround some text with two asterisks (`**`) on both sides, the text **becomes bold**. That's markdown.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cells can also contain code. If you are writing in a cell that is for Python code, everything in that cell must be valid Python code or you will see an error.\n",

While in insert mode, you can edit the cells and undo changes within that cell with `cmd + z` on a Mac or `ctl + z` on Windows. In escape mode, you can add cells with `b`, delete a cell with `x`, and undo deletion of a cell with `z`.  You can also change the type of a cell to markdown with `m` and to Python code with `y`.  \n",
